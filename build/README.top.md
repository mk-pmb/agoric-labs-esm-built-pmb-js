esm + agoric labs patch + packaged for npm
==========================================

* Original `esm` module (seemingly unmaintained):
  https://github.com/standard-things/esm
* Maintenance fork by Agoric Labs:
  https://github.com/agoric-labs/esm/
  * Original project announcement thread:
    https://github.com/standard-things/esm/issues/897
  * Bundling for npm:
    https://github.com/mk-pmb/agoric-labs-esm-built-pmb-js/


⚠ Upstream is unmaintained! ⚠
-----------------------------

Unfortunately, while writing this module, it turned out that the Agoric fork
[is no longer maintained](https://github.com/standard-things/esm/issues/897)
either.

Its tests fail on my CI, and on my dev machine the build fails, but their built
version works for me, so I'll publish it anyway [as was requested][npm-plz].
